/**
 * @brief Splits a wide-character string into tokens.
 *
 * @details A sequence of calls breaks the wide-character 
 * string pointed to by @p s into a sequence of tokens, each
 * of delimited by a wide-character code from the wide-character
 * string pointed to by @p delim. The @p lasts argument points to
 * a caller-provided wchar_t pointer into the function stores information
 * necessary for it to continue scanning the same wide-character string.
 *
 * @return Returns a pointer to the first wide-character code of a token. 
 * Otherwise, if there is no token, returns a null pointer.
