/*  The traditional meaning of 'extern inline' for GCC is not
  to emit the function body unless the address is explicitly
  taken.  However this behaviour is changing to match the C99
  standard, which uses 'extern inline' to indicate that the
  function body *must* be emitted.  Likewise, a function declared
  without either 'extern' or 'static' defaults to extern linkage
  (C99 6.2.2p5), and the compiler may choose whether to use the
  inline version or call the extern linkage version (6.7.4p6).
  If we are using GCC, but do not have the new behaviour, we need
  to use extern inline; if we are using a new GCC with the
  C99-compatible behaviour, or a non-GCC compiler (which we will
  have to hope is C99, since there is no other way to achieve the
  effect of omitting the function if it isn't referenced) we use
  'static inline', which c99 defines to mean more-or-less the same
  as the Gnu C 'extern inline'.  */
