WHAT IS NANVIX?

	Nanvix is a Unix-like operating system written by Pedro H. Penna for 
	educational purposes. It is designed to be simple and small, but also 
	modern and fully featured.
	
WHAT HARDWARE IS REQUIRED?

	Nanvix targets 32-bit x86-based PCs and only requires a floppy or 
	CD-ROM drive and 16 MB of RAM. You can run it either in a real PC 
	or in a virtual machine, from a Live System's Image, available 
	at: 
	
		sourceforge.net/projects/nanvix/files/
	
BUILDING

	In order to build Nanvix, you will need a Linux like programming 
	environment, the x86 GCC compiler and the x86 GNU binutils.
	
	Once you have setup the required tools, you should set the 
	environment variable $TARGET to point to the toolchain's directory. 
	
	When done, you can build Nanvix by typing, at the root directory:
	
		$ make all
	
	Or you can build a Live System's Image by typing, at the same directory:
	
		# make image
	
	Note that for build a image you may require priveleged access.

	TIP: If you are running a Debian-based Linux distribution, like Ubuntu, 
	you can simply run the scripts/setup-toolchain.sh script.
